# Title Generator v3.0.10

> **Latest Update**: Auto version bump enabled - every commit/push increments version automatically. Added **Debug Mode** toggle for troubleshooting logs.

A completely rewritten Obsidian plugin to generate note titles using multiple AI providers. This new version is built for stability, efficiency, and intelligence, with guaranteed compatibility on both Desktop and Mobile (Android/iOS).

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Model Loading with Search**: Automatically detects and loads available models from your configured AI providers with a searchable dropdown - no more hardcoded model lists!
- **Intelligent Title Refinement**: If an AI-generated title is too long, the plugin asks the AI to shorten it, preserving the core meaning instead of just cutting it off.
- **Cost-Efficient Analysis**: Limit the amount of text sent to the AI (e.g., the first 2000 characters) to significantly reduce token usage and cost on long notes.
- **Multi-Provider AI**: Choose from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini.
- **Smart Model Caching**: Models are cached with TTL (1 hour) and automatically refreshed when API keys change.
- **Mobile-First Design**: All API calls use Obsidian's native `fetch` API, ensuring 100% compatibility on mobile devices and removing heavy dependencies.
- **Fully Customizable Prompts**: Tailor the initial prompt and the refinement prompt to fit your exact needs.
- **Smart Filename Sanitization**: Automatically removes OS-forbidden characters and normalizes whitespace to create safe, clean filenames.
- **Debug Mode**: Enable detailed console logging for troubleshooting.

| **Model**                    | The specific AI model to use for generation. Models are loaded dynamically from your provider with a searchable dropdown.          | Auto-detected from provider                                                                            |
| **Initial Prompt**           | The prompt template for the first request. Use `{max_length}` as a placeholder.                         | `Generate a concise, descriptive title for the following text. The title must be a maximum of {max_length} characters.` |

| **Temperature**              | Controls AI creativity (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = highly creative).                                    | `0.7`                                                                                                  |

| **Lower-case titles**        | If enabled, converts all titles to lower case.                                                          | `false`                                                                                                |

## Dynamic Model Loading

The plugin now automatically detects and loads available models from your configured AI providers:

### How It Works

1. **Auto-Detection**: When you set an API key or server URL, the plugin automatically queries for available models
2. **Searchable Interface**: Type to filter through available models in a user-friendly dropdown
3. **Smart Caching**: Models are cached for 1 hour to reduce API calls and improve performance
4. **Reload Button**: Click the refresh button next to the model dropdown to manually reload models
5. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages help troubleshoot connection issues
6. **Fallback Models**: If model loading fails, the plugin falls back to a curated list of popular models

### Model Loading Triggers

- Setting or changing an API key for cloud providers
- Changing API keys for cloud providers
- Switching between AI providers
- Clicking the reload models button
- Opening settings (if models are older than 1 hour)

### Example Models (Auto-detected)

-   **OpenAI**: `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4`, etc.
-   **Anthropic**: `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`, `claude-3-opus-20240229`, etc.
-   **Google Gemini**: `gemini-3-flash-preview`, `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`, `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`, etc.

## Thinking Mode (Google Gemini 3)

For Gemini 3 models, you can enable reasoning/thinking capabilities via the **Thinking Level** setting. This allows the model to process more complex information before generating a title.

| Level | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `Off` | Standard generation. |
| `Low` | Minimal reasoning. |
| `Medium` | Balanced reasoning. |
| `High` | Maximum reasoning depth. |

## Troubleshooting

### General Issues

-   **Invalid API Key**: Double-check your API key in your provider's dashboard.
-   **Network Errors**: For cloud providers, ensure you have an internet connection.
-   **No Title Generated**: Check the Obsidian developer console (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I`) for any error messages from the plugin.

### Model Loading Issues

-   **Models Not Loading**: Click the reload button (🔄) next to the model dropdown to manually refresh the model list.
-   **"Loading models..." Stuck**: Check your internet connection and API key. The plugin has a 10-second timeout for model queries.
-   **Error Messages in Settings**: Hover over the model dropdown description to see detailed error messages and timestamps.
-   **Fallback Models**: If model loading fails, the plugin will show a curated list of popular models as fallback.

### Provider-Specific Issues

-   **OpenAI**: Ensure your API key has the correct permissions and billing is set up.
-   **Anthropic**: API key must be from the Anthropic Console, not Claude.ai.
-   **Google Gemini**: Use API key from Google AI Studio, not Google Cloud Console.
